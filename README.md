Taxi Data Analysis
I have uploaded the dataset taxis.csv, which contains information about taxi rides. This project involves analyzing the data using NumPy in Python. The analysis addresses the following questions:

Mean Speed of All Rides: Calculates the average speed of taxi rides.
Total Number of Rides in February: Counts the number of rides that occurred in February.
Rides with Tips Above $50: Identifies the number of rides where the tip exceeded $50.
Rides with Drop-off at JFK Airport: Determines the number of rides with a drop-off at JFK Airport (code 2 in the dataset).
The dataset is processed efficiently by skipping the header rows to speed up data loading.

Feel free to explore the code and data, and use it as you see fit!
